(Edited by Elliott on 2-22 for appearance/other suggestions)

TODO:
  - Add real stylesheets
  - Add options to toolbar items and toolbar itself
  - Fix bug when long identifiers are present
  - Clean up js code (put into separate files if need be)
  - Add quiz overlay
  - Full documentation

Other notes [Elliott]:
  - Probably best to use iteration through ParseResult.parsedElements instead of aggregating dates, identifiers and others
  
[The following may not be relevant to your work, Cameron, but rather Kat's:]
  - Appearance-wise, the sidebar should probably be aligned with the text input box and bordered similarly
  - It should have a title. Doesn't have to be too obtrusive, but right now the app is a blank slate
